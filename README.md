Decision trees and regression trees are powerful non-parametric supervised learning methods used for both classification and regression tasks, respectively. Decision trees split the dataset into subsets based on the features that best separate the target variable (classification) or predict its value (regression), while regression trees specifically predict continuous values by partitioning the data into segments based on feature thresholds. Understanding these methods provides robust tools for handling complex decision-making processes and predictive modeling tasks in machine learning.
